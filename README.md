# Credit-Risk-Prediction
A Machine Learning based web application that predicts the credit risk of a customer based on demographic, financial, credit history, employment, and loan details.

The system uses a trained machine learning model to calculate the *Risk Score* and classify the customer into *Low, Medium, or High Risk*.

---

## Project Overview

Banks and financial institutions need to evaluate the risk before approving loans. This project helps in predicting whether a customer is likely to default on a loan.

This application takes customer information as input and returns:

- Risk Score
- Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)
- Probability of each risk category

---

## Features

- Machine Learning based prediction
- FastAPI backend for model serving
- Streamlit UI for interactive user interface
- Risk Score prediction
- Probability distribution for risk classes
- Organized input sections for better usability
